**fuckForticlient** is a command-line utility to connect to SAML fortivpn servers by using **openfortivpn** and the --cookie-in-stdin parameter.
This repo was formerly a [Github gist](https://gist.github.com/nonamed01).
This script has been written for and tested on Debian GNU/Linux distros and derivatives. With minor changes, it may also work on RPM-based distros such as Fedora, etc.

## Why?

Well, because the official Forticlient for GNU/Linux is total crap! \
When I wrote this script, the main idea was to solve a problem that I though temporary... and, well, one year in and the official Forticlient GNU/Linux client is still total crap... so, heck, it looks like we'll be using this for quite a long time...

## Usage

```bash
   ___         __    ____         __  _     ___          __
  / _/_ ______/ /__ / __/__  ____/ /_(_)___/ (_)__ ___  / /_

## Alias
If you do not want to re-type every single time the command to connect to your FortiVPN provider, you can add this alias to your ~.bashrc file:

```bash
    alias vpn='FUCKFORTICLIENT_OPTS="--no-dns" fuckForticlient.sh -S VPN_SERVER -c'
```

After re-loading your ~.bashrc, you can connect to the vpn by simply running:

```bash
    vpn
```
